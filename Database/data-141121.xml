It's a question most of us are asked at a young age; obviously we all want to be astronauts, cowboys, firemen, police officers, rock stars, princesses and professional athletes. Who says you have to give up on your childhood dreams? Dreams are the foundation for growth, and no matter how far-fetched they may be, they are still attainable. We at Momentum are dreamers too, but we call them something different: GOALS . Our goals: to expand nationwide, and into international markets. To facilitate the growth of our clients and to continue to provide industry leading results in new customer acquisition and retention, while expanding our clients brand. How do companies grow? Healthy leadership and strong management, that's how, and that's exactly what we develop. So you don't have sales or marketing experience, no problem. Neither did we until they taught us everything we needed to advance, then they taught us more. Growth can be described by upward mobility or vertical growth, very two dimensional. What we focus on at Momentum is a lateral and vertical growth structure. So we develop our executives into a three dimensional leaders, giving a variety of skill that are transferable across all markets. We were the kids that wanted to make a difference in the world, leave our mark as they say- We have that ability now. We're working with over 20 clients here in Cincinnati to expand their brand names not just in the Midwest but Nationwide. What we look for, are dreamers. People who are willing to commit to the process and with proper coaching can move into a managerial role and help expand our clients and help our organization grow. College education is recommended but not a must.. Steve Jobs didn't graduate and he was pretty successful, so we would hate to miss out on someone who has just decided to pursue other avenues. Positivity is a must, if you're complaining about our bad sense of humor no need to apply. If you're following along and keeping up with us this far send us a copy of your resume and be prepared to hear from our administrative team as they are the back bone behind our success, and they will be the ones who determine if we move forward with the process.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 05:00:00 Z</pubDate></item><item><title>Assistant Property Manager</title><link>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHQ0B763GBWPZBWY4ZK&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</link><guid>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHQ0B763GBWPZBWY4ZK&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</guid><description>Details: Preservation Housing Management is a high-performance property management affiliate of one of the nation’s most accomplished affordable housing owner /developers.

OUR SEARCH IS FOR ASSISTANT MANAGERS LOOKING TO ADVANCE IN THE FOODSERVICE INDUSTRY! •** CURRENTLY RECRUITING ASSISTANT MANAGERS FOR OUR LAREDO LOCATIONS*** Currently scheduling in-person interviews. Why Management roles at Wingstop are different from other restaurants: • Our management team leads the crew members from a "100 % hands on" position within the kitchen area of the restaurant. • Management does not have offices, so it lends itself to being with guests and crew members at ALL times. • Our restaurants do not have wait staff or tipped employees. • Most locations open at 11:00 AM and close at 12:00 AM which means a healthy work/life balance working only 50 to 55 hours a week. • Requires interpersonal and leadership skills, combined with boundless enthusiasm. • Our managers must have an eye for "consistent" food quality and a clean, spotless, restaurant. • We look for people who are passionate about food and feel it is essential for success. This all might seem hard to attain but we structure our management responsibilities in a way that allows you to work "hands on" with your staff and we keep you out of the office doing paperwork.</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 05:00:00 Z</pubDate></item><item><title>Social Worker - Licensed</title><link>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHM14B739W9HN5WJ677&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</link><guid>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHM14B739W9HN5WJ677&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</guid><description>Details: Horizon Health , in partnership with our client hospital, the Mobile Infirmary , is seeking a licensed Social Worker for our adult and geriatric inpatient psychiatric programs.
