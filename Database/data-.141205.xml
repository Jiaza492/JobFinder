Experience working in a mid-large scale environment, but where the SA's take a holistic approach, meaning they work with multiple technologies on the systems side, but have a deep understanding of AD. Other candidates have fallen short because they have been too dedicated to one technology in the past and struggled with being able to work with and understand multiple things. Job Description: This Systems Administrator will be a part of a small team (7 Admins and Engineers) that is responsible for supporting 4,000 users (both onsite and remote) and about 300 servers. They are 60% virtualized (VMware). Their goal is to be as virtualized as possible to minimize hardware costs. The day-to-day will focus on engineering, implementing, and administering systems like AD, Exchange and Citrix. Right now, the team is lacking deep AD knowledge, so that will be this person's primary focus. Additional Information: Over the next several years they will be migrating their farm of over 200 Windows servers including the Active Directory environment to Windows Server 2012, migrating our their Exchange environment to Exchange 2013, and supporting organizational initiatives to modernize desktop management via integration of corporate desktops into our enterprise Active Directory farm. They are also developing an off-site disaster recovery capability in North Carolina for the most critical systems, and are starting to explore the use of external cloud-based platforms for certain applications. In addition, they are in the process of replacing most of our major business systems (fundraising, financial, etc.) with new commercial-off-the-shelf applications, and developing custom conservation and legal systems, which make heavy use of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server.
