They're looking for an experienced Business Analyst (BA) to conduct an information gathering exercise to document the capabilities of a legacy ColdFusion application and its associated business processes.

The ultimate goal is to either rewrite or replace this system with a COTS solution, and we are beginning with a full requirements capture effort. The BA will formally document the business process and system requirements by interviewing subject matter experts and studying how the MWA system functions today. The scope is not limited to the existing capabilities of the legacy system, and the BA is expected to leverage his or her expertise to identify areas for possible improvements and record them as enhancement requests. The final deliverable needs to be highly detailed, including but not limited to wireframes, process flow diagrams, pseudo-code for complex business logic, data models, data validation rules, values for drop-downs, field widths, etc. There should be sufficient detail that an application developer can consume the information and begin immediately to design and code the application.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2014 05:00:00 Z</pubDate></item><item><title>Sybase Applications Analyst</title><link>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=J3J46L6QBMS3LVWW56L&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</link><guid>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=J3J46L6QBMS3LVWW56L&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</guid><description>Details: Job Description If you are an experienced Sybase Applications Analyst looking for a position with a leading company, Bartech can help!

Candidates can be located anywhere, but the preference is Reston, VA, or Raleigh, NC. Target salary range is $120,000 - $140,000. No sponsorship available. Our client is seeking an ambitious software engineer who possesses a strong understanding of software engineering process and methodologies as well as object-oriented design and programming experience. You will work as a software development engineer within a project team responsible for the design and development. You will be monitoring applications - in this case, applications that are specifically targeted for monitoring mass storage systems. Responsibilities of the Software Engineer: Monitoring systems: We are looking for people with experience being responsible for keeping storage systems running and performing well, or for developing the management platforms and/or APIs for the managed storage devices, or for developing 3rd party management systems that manage state-of-the-art storage systems. Anyone who has used or developed various tools to measure performance and track service availability and wished they could offer ideas and improvements to those tools will get the opportunity to “do it better" here. Communicating with vendor’s equipment: HTTP, SSH, SNMP, and other protocols (e.g. SMI-S, ONTAP) are used to provide information to and from third party systems. The data can be encoded in XML, JSON, ASN.1, text, or other formats. We need people who can create efficient, scalable “dynamic applications" of our product to collect megabytes of data from thousands of systems at regular intervals. This is the place to bring ideas about using caching, threads, and other scaling methods for handling large amounts of disparate data. Vertical product knowledge: Bring with you and/or learn details about storage systems and platforms (e.g. Brocade, Dell, EMC, HP, Hitachi, IBM, NetApp) – both state-of-the-art, and leading edge. We need storage management specialists with a passion for making monitoring “right"; not just “good enough". You will attend conferences, use advanced lab equipment, speak with customers to understand their use cases, and work with product management peers to build the best monitoring solutions for storage applications in the marketplace. You will work in conjunction with other engineers in adjacent monitoring areas (e.g. vBlock and FlexPod) to ensure the relationships between storage, network, and compute are not just visible, but provide pro-active, predictive and pre-emptive information for our customers. Our customers? The IT teams of some of the most prominent Enterprises and Managed Service Providers in the industry who are charged with keeping advanced hybrid cloud-based applications running 24x7.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2014 05:00:00 Z</pubDate></item><item><title>Data Integration Developer</title><link>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHV6WZ74S3MJT35Y3FH&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</link><guid>http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?siteid=RSS_PD&amp;Job_DID=JHV6WZ74S3MJT35Y3FH&amp;ipath=rss_geoip</guid><description>Details: Position: Integration Developer Commute: Remote/Downtown Chicago Duration: Contract to Hire Start Date: ASAP Compensation: Flexible Overview: This person will be working with healthcare provider data to extract and load it into our client’s Healthcare Oracle database for analysis.
